**Introduction**

The Naval Signal Simulation model is intended to simulate the transmission and reception of naval signal messages, using the NATO standard. This guide will cover the basic principles of the system, including the use of pennant flags, numeral pennants, and spoken commands.

**Pennant Flags**

The pennant flag system uses a combination of flags to convey specific information, such as direction, speed, and formation. The following pennant flags are used:

* N (Nekops): indicates a change in direction or course
* E (Ettirw): indicates the end of a message or transmission
* O (One-code answer): used to acknowledge receipt of a message
* P (Port screen speed): indicates the direction and speed of a ship's port side
* S (Starboard formation): indicates the direction and formation of ships

**Numeral Pennants**

The numeral pennant system uses a series of flags to convey numerical information, such as course changes or speeds. The following numeral pennants are used:

* 0: indicates zero speed or no change
* 1-9: indicates specific speeds (e.g., 5 knots)
* Tack tackline: indicates the direction and angle of a ship's track

**Spoken Commands**

In addition to visual signals, naval messages can also be transmitted using spoken commands. The following spoken commands are used:

* "Leave harbor": indicates the departure from a port or anchorage
* "Zigzag" (ging): indicates a change in direction or course
* "Alter course wheeling": indicates a change in direction or course
* "Resume base course": indicates a return to the original course

**Simulation**

The Naval Signal Simulation model can be used to simulate the transmission and reception of naval signals. The simulation will involve:

1. Inputting the signal message using the NATO standardized system
2. Simulating the transmission of the signal using visual flags or spoken commands
3. Simulating the receipt and interpretation of the signal by the receiving ship

**Conclusion**

The Naval Signal Simulation model is a useful tool for training naval personnel in the use of standardized signals. This guide has provided an overview of the principles of the system, including the use of pennant flags, numeral pennants, and spoken commands. The simulation can be used to practice transmitting and receiving naval signals, and can help improve communication and coordination among naval units.

I'll be playing the role of a naval signal simulation model, and I will respond to your inputs as if I were a real-world naval signaling system.

To start, I need some context. What kind of scenario would you like to simulate? Would you like to simulate a specific type of naval operation (e.g., convoy escort, search and rescue), or do you have a specific goal in mind (e.g., navigating through a minefield)? Let me know, and I'll help facilitate the simulation!

I'll start interpreting the signals and commands in this naval signal simulation. Please let me know what specific action you'd like me to take.

The simulation is using the NATO Unclassified Air Traffic Publication, Volume II (ATP-01, Vol. II), Edition G, Version 1.

To get started, I need to understand the format of the signals and commands. The simulation appears to use a combination of numerical and alphabetical codes, with some specific flags and pennants used to convey information.

Some examples of code sequences:

* NA 36 27-6: Indicates an execution signal.
* Corpen V 7-7: Cease zigzagging and remain course steered.
* Turn X 6-4: Convoy carrying out a zigzag plan.
* Screen Ship carry Independent Zigzag: (Turn H 6-3) Speed changed.

I'll continue to interpret the signals and commands as we progress through the simulation. Please let me know what specific actions you'd like me to take or what scenarios you'd like to simulate.

**Simulation Started**

You are the commander of a naval vessel. You receive a signal indicating an execution signal with a specific course and speed.

Signal: **NA 36 27-6**

This signal indicates to leave harbor at zero time, proceed in a zigzag pattern (Ging), alter course wheeling, and then resume zigzagging.

What do you want to do?

1. Follow the signal and execute the course change.
2. Query further information about the signal.
3. Request confirmation of the signal before executing the course change.
4. Ignore the signal and continue with your previous plan.

Please respond with one of the above options (1-4).
