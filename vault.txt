**AI Response:** - **Signal:** "PREPARE FOR REPLENISHMENT AT SEA" - **Additional Signals:** - "REPLENISHMENT COURSE 045" - "SPEED 12 KNOTS" - "APPROACH THE REPLENISHMENT SHIP FROM PORT SIDE"3. **Continuing Replenishment at Sea** - **User Command:** "Continue the replenishment at sea serial" - **AI Response:** - **Signal:** "STATION KEEPING REPLENISHMENT SHIP AT 200 YARDS" - **Additional Signals:** - "STANDBY FOR FUEL TRANSFER" - "READY TO COMMENCE REPLENISHMENT"4.**Commencing Replenishment** - **User Command:** "Now what" - **AI Response:** - **Signal:** "COMMENCE FUEL TRANSFER"5.**Completing Replenishment** - **User Command:** "Complete the serial and send the receiving ship to a station 2000 yards on your port beam" - **AI Response:** - **Signal:** "REPLENISHMENT AT SEA SERIAL COMPLETE" - **Stationing Signal:** "STATION PORT 90—1" (to indicate 1 nautical mile on the port beam using a relative bearing)#### Additional Commands and Responses1.
**Turning and Speed Adjustment:** - **User Command:** "Tell all ships to turn to port to a new course of 79 and increase speed to 16 knots. Do this by the delayed executive method." - **AI Response:** - **Turn Signal:** "TURN PORT 079 DELAYED EXEC" - **Speed Signal:** "SPEED 16 DELAYED EXEC" - **Expected Responses:** Ships will acknowledge with the affirmative pennant.Once all acknowledgments are received, the execution signal ("EXEC") will be hoisted to indicate the commands should be executed.2.**Emergency Turn:** - **User Command:** "How should I tell another ship to turn to port to 180 in an emergency?" - **AI Response:** - **Signal:** "EMERG TURN PORT 180"3.**Wheeling:** - **User Command:** "Tell all ships to wheel to 190" - **AI Response:** - **Signal:** "CORPEN 190"4.
**Stationing:** - **User Command:** "Tell the receiving ship to a station 2000 yards on your port beam" - **AI Response:** - **Signal:** "STATION PORT 90—1" (to indicate 1 nautical mile on the port beam using a relative bearing)#### Ending the Simulation1. **User Command:** "STOP SIMULATION"2.**AI Response:** The AI should acknowledge the end of the simulation.

It contains maneuvering signals, standard operational signals, the more common administrative signals, and basic maneuvering instructions. The book is designed for communication between naval units of all types.It can be used with any method of signaling.NATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 1-3 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIED102 Security Warning A simple unchanging code such as that used in this book has no security at all.If the method of signaling utilized is subject to interception by any means, great care should be taken to limit the messages to those that contain unclassi ﬁ ed information.If security is required, an appropriate cryptographic system must be used.103 Use and Interpretation a.Arrangement of Signals.The signal vocabulary of this book is collected into chapters and arranged under headings for ease of reference.Chapter 2 contains single ﬂ ag and pennant signals.Chapter 3 contains emergency alarm and emergency action signals.
Chapters 4 to 9 contain maneuvering signals utilizing a special pennant. Chapters 10 to 35 contain the main signal vocabulary, which consists of operational and administrative signals arranged alphabetically under appropriate headings.The signal index at the end will assist the user in ﬁ nding the desired groups when encoding signals.The use of all capital letters in a signal indicates the primary word(s) or phrase(s) under which the signal is indexed.Do not read a word or phrase in all capital letters as part of the signal, unless it is required to complete the meaning of the signal.b.Encoding.To encode a signal, reference should be made ﬁ rst to the signal index where the groups will be found indexed under the key words of the meaning of the group.Reference must then be made to the signal vocabulary chapters, which are indicated by the reference numbers in the index.The meanings in the index are not complete; instructions have been omitted and only the basic meaning is given.
For this reason, the index is not to be used separately for encoding signals. c.Decoding.To decode a signal, reference should be made to the single ﬂ ag and pennant chapter, special pennant chapters, or the main signal vocabulary, as applicable, for the basic signal.d.Sense when Action is Signaled.A signal from this book ordering an action to be carried out is to be read in its imperative sense if made by a senior; if made by a junior, the signal should read as a request for the action to be carried out by the senior to whom it is addressed.e.Special Flag and Pennant Signals.The special pennant signals in Chapters 4 to 9 are in general arranged so that, for those requiring action, the special pennant precedes the alphabetical ﬂ ag, and for those signaled for information, the special pennant follows the alphabetical ﬂ ag.The information signals in Chapters 4 to 9 are not to be repeated or answered unless preceded by a call.Information signals are not to be used to order an action.f.
Selection of the Appropriate Signal. The instructions peculiar to the execution of any particular signal are found in this book along with the meaning of the signal.However, the consideration affecting the choice of any particular signal, as well as the restrictions on its use, are contained in Allied Maritime Tactical Procedures and Instructions (V olume I).When required, relevant chapter references are shown as a note against the signal.g.Singular and Plural.Groups in this book may be used in either the singular or plural sense.h.Completing a Signal.Where a “____ ”or “ as indicated ”appears in the meaning of a signal, it is always to be completed with a suf ﬁ x or supplementing data unless an interrogative sense is implied (e.g., INT AS27).Where a “ ( ____ ), ” an “ (as indicated), ” or an instruction in parentheses appears, the addition of suf ﬁ xes or supplementing data is optional.Other instructions are self-explanatory.i.Numerals.
The numerals used with signals in this book represent numeral ﬂ ags unless it is speciﬁ cally indicated that they are numeral pennants. Numeral ﬂ ags are written as digits, e.g., 1, 34; the same numbers by numeral pennants are written as p1, p3, p4.1-4 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II j.Tackline.The tackline is transmitted and spoken TACK and written as a dash “—.” It is used: (1) To avoid ambiguity, by separating signals or groups of numerals which, if not separated, could convey a different meaning from that intended.(2) When, for the needs of a particular signal, the instructions order that a tackline be used.When there are more ﬂ ags in a signal than can be made in a single hoist the signal should be broken into two or more hoists, the breaks being made where TACK would normally be inserted to avoid ambiguity.Examples: N—STATION ...Your movements are not understood.Take proper or assigned station.RE2—1—48 ..
.Prepare to receive 48 personnel casualties.EMERG Q2—345—10 . ..I am investigating a radar contact still unclassi ﬁ ed which might be a submarine, bearing 345°, range 1,000 yards.104 Signals Covering More Than One Meaning a.Chapter Group.A chapter group is a two-letter group allocated to a particular chapter and the main vocabulary from which all signals in that chapter are derived.It is normally formed by the ﬁ rst two letters of the chapter title; but where this is not possible, a self-evident group has been allocated.Examples: AS....Antisubmarine warfare.CM ...Communications.EW ...Electronic warfare.b.Basic Group.A basic group is a signal consisting of the chapter group followed by one or more ﬁ gures, as listed in the signal vocabulary, with no addition whatsoever.As indicated in paragraph 103h, basic groups containing a “ ___ ” or “ as indicated ” in the meaning of the signal may not be used alone.c.Suf ﬁ xes.
Many signals in this book contain a list of numeral and/or letter suf ﬁ xes in the meaning of the signal. These lists are provided so that the basic meaning can be varied by the use of the appropriate suf ﬁ x(es).When a suf ﬁ x is used, it must follow the last ﬁ gure of the group separated by a TACK.The tackline may be omitted if the omission cannot cause ambiguity.Examples: ED1...Anchor is ____ .(Note this group cannot be used alone, a sufﬁ x must be added to complete the meaning.) ED1—4 ...Anchor is foul.TA62 ...Investigate.TA62—18 ...Investigate small boat.TA62—1—8.....Investigate buoy and lightship (tackline avoids confusion with 18).1R6 ...I have a bottomed submarine contact.NATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 1-5 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDd.Sequence of Data.There are certain signals in which the sequence of the data to be signaled is indicated in the meaning.
Except for the last item(s) of such data, NEGAT must be signaled in place of any item that is not being signaled. Examples: 1P...SUBMARINE’ s bearing, range, depth, course, and speed are as indicated from this unit or unit indicated.(a) Bearing (b) Range in hundreds of yards (c) Depth in tens of feet (d) Course (e) Speed (f) Time 1P 125 ...SUBMARINE’ s bearing is 125° from this unit.1P NEGAT 12....SUBMARINE’ s range is 1,200 yards from this unit.1P 125 NEGAT NEGAT 320 ....SUBMARINE’ s bearing is 125° from this unit and its course is 320°.105 Signals with No Meaning Type, ﬂ eet, and appropriate task organization commanders may assign meanings for signals that presently have no meaning listed in this publication.Meanings for such signals will be promulgated in operation orders for a speci ﬁ c operation, as promulgated by the commander’s operation or exercise order.110 Supplementing Signals The signals from this book may be supplemented or modi ﬁ ed by: (1) Governing pennants.
(2) Governing groups.(3) Call signs, sequence numbers, and unit indicators.(4) Description signals.(5) Plain text.(6) Operating signals.(7) International Code of Signals.(8) Tables. 1-6 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 111 Governing Pennants a.Table of Meanings.Pennant Preceding the Signal PREPARATIVE Prepare to ____ .INTERROGATIVE Questions or inquiries.NEGATIVE Cease, do not ____ , or gives a negative sense to an otherwise af ﬁ rmative or informative statement.b.Position in the Signal.The governing pennant immediately precedes the signal.Examples: PREP SCREEN H1.....Prepare to form sector screen.PREP TA2—8 ...Prepare to attack under smoke screen.INT TA2 ...Are you attacking?NEGAT TA2 ...Do not attack, or cease attacking.c.Use with Several Signals.When one governing pennant is used with several signals.the following rules apply: (1) All Signals.The governing pennant shall govern all signals when separated from the signals by a TACK.
(2) One Signal Only. If the governing pennant is required to govern only one of several signals, it must immediately precede the signal to be governed; other signals must be separated from the governed signal by TACK.Examples: TA94 ....Close me.RS8—1 ...Replenish ammunition.AD18 ...Send medical of ﬁ cer as soon as possible.PREP—TA94—RS8—1—AD18 ...Prepare to close me; prepare to replenish ammunition; prepare to send medical of ﬁ cer as soon as possible.PREP—TA94—AD18—NEGAT RS8—1...Prepare to close me; prepare to send medical of ﬁ cer as soon as possible; do not replenish ammunition.TA94—PREP RS8—1—NEGAT AD18...Close me; prepare to replenish ammunition; do not send medical of ﬁ cer.NATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 1-7 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIED112 Governing Groups a.Table of Meanings.

Position in the Signal.The governing group, followed by a tackline, precedes the signal and governs that signal only.The governing group may be used alone when no ambiguity will result.Examples: TA94.....Close me.TA2 .....Attack.BB—TA2 ...Attack completed.BE—TA2—TA94 ...Report when ready to attack; close me.c.
Use with Several Signals. When the governing group applies to two or more signals following it, BX is inserted after the last of the signals to which the governing group is to apply.Examples: TA36...Show no light.TA88—3 ...Proceed as previously directed.ED18 ...Weigh anchor.ED54 ...Leave harbor.1-8 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II BG—TA36—ED18 BX ...My present intention is to show no light and weigh anchor.TA36—ED18—BE—ED54—TA88—3 BX ...Show no light; weigh anchor; report when ready to leave harbor and proceed as previously directed.BK—ED18—TA88—3 BX—BI—ED54...When you desire, weigh anchor and proceed as previously directed; I am not leaving harbor.BU—26B....Unable to delay enemy.113 Call Signs, Sequence Numbers, and Unit Indicators a.Call Signs and Sequence Numbers.Call signs, address groups, and sequence numbers may be used in conjunction with groups from this book to complete, amplify, or vary the meaning of the signal.
Numerals appearing in visual call signs represent numeral pennants, except in the Special Task Organization Calls (ACP-130), where a numeral ﬂ ag/numeral pennant combination is used. Sequence numbers are represented by numeral ﬂ ags.The following format is to be used to address or indicate ships, units.or commanders.(1) Call signs indicating ships, units, or commanders referred to in the meaning of the signal follow the entire signal, except for signals indicating bearing and distance from a unit where the call sign appears within the signal (see Article 196).Examples: RE42—8 NEGAT 10 NEGAT NEGAT 25 Cp3p7 ...Readiness of Cruiser 37 is: 8 antiaircraft guns usable, 10 main battery guns usable, maximum possible speed 25 knots.BG—AD5—8A—Cp3p7...My present intention is to send helicopter to Cruiser 37 for the Admiral.
(2) In circumstances where the call does not adequately serve as the address, a call sign may immediately precede a signal in order to speci ﬁ cally address ships, units, or commanders to take the signal for action. Example: All ships, this is the OTC—1—Dp6p7 AS19—2—Dp7 AS18 ....A l l ships, this is the OTC: destroyers 6 and 7 form SAU and investigate contact; destroyer 7 assume command as SAU commander.b.Unit Indicators.A unit indicator (i.e., FLOT/GROUP, SQUAD, DIV , SUBDIV) following a signal indicates the unit to be used in carrying out the meaning of the signal.Example: TA2 DIV ......ATTACK.The attack unit is the DIVISION.114 Description Signals Description signals may be used to describe own or enemy forces or to convey other information.A description signal consists of DESIG followed by: (1) Numerals indicating how many (if required), and/or (2) Single-letter “type” indicator(s) or multiletter “class” designator(s).Example: E MERG E 345—10 DESIG 3CL2D ....
Enemy surface cra ft sighted bearing 345° from this ship, distance 10 miles, are three light cruisers and two destroyers. NATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 1-9 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIED115 Plain Text When appropriate, DESIG followed by letter(s) and/or numerals(s) must be used to indicate that such a group is to be interpreted literally, such as octal numbers used to designate a datum or track number, and not as a coded group.DESIG shall immediately precede the group to be interpreted literally and will govern only that group.When more than one group are to be interpreted literally, DESIG will govern all groups separated from the groups by TACK.Exceptions to this are: when a plain number must be used to complete the meaning of a signal as explained in paragraph 103h (e.g., A V26—3, “I am operating ﬁ xed- wing aircraft”); and when used as prescribed in the meaning of the signals contained in Chapter 20.
In this way, words may be spelled out within the text of a signal to complete or modify the meaning. Plan indicators, points, numbers, berths, etc., may also be signaled without con ﬂ icting with signal groups.DESIG must not be used to signal sectors (see Article 198).Examples: TA117—3 DESIG CHILE ...Identity of unit is neutral and of Chilean registry.EX3—5—16 DESIG 2B Exercise 2B is postponed until 1600.AS19—3 DESIG 3130 Form SAU and investigate datum 3130.116 Operating Signals The Q and Z Communication Operating Signals contained in ACP-131 may be used alone or to supplement groups from this book.The miscellaneous abbreviations and symbols in ACP-131, are not to be used by ﬂ aghoist or to supplement groups from this book.Example: CM11—2—ZJD1 ...Expedite signals by answering more promptly.Use better light.117 International Code of Signals Groups from the International Code of Signals may be used alone or in conjunction with signal groups from this book.
Whenever international groups are used alone in a ﬂ aghoist, international procedure is to be used in answering. (1) Whenever military use is made of the International Code of Signals, groups will be preceded by CODE when transmitted by ﬂ aghoist, or INTERCO by Morse, voice, or semaphore.(a) Whenever international signals are used alone, CODE or INTERCO followed by TACK shall be used as the ﬁ rst group to indicate that all groups following are taken from the International Code of Signals.When the signal consists of only one group, TACK may be omitted.(b) Whenever signals from this book are supplemented by a group from the International Code of Signals, CODE or INTERCO shall immediately precede the signal group to indicate that only that group is taken from the International Code of Signals.(c) For ﬂ aghoist signaling, a call sign preceding CODE indicates Allied procedure will be used in answering, repeating, questioning, and canceling the display.
For multiple signals, a call sign preceding CODE may be hoisted in a superior position and left ﬂ ying during several succeeding hoists of international code groups. In either case, hauling down the call sign and CODE indicates the end of the message.(2) When communicating with non-military ships or stations or non-Allied warships, refer to the International Code of Signals.1-10 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 118 Tables a.Action Tables.The AAW Action (Flag 7) Table in Chapter 10, the ASW Action (Flag 1) Table in Chapter 13, and the Surface Action (Flags 2, 3, and 4) and Torpedo Action (Flag 9) Tables in Chapter 32 enable the most important and commonly used signals to be made in the shortest possible form.The numeral ﬂ ag indicator for the table may be left ﬂ ying in a superior position when successive signals from the same table are being made.b.Supplementary Tables.
The Supplementary Tables A, B, C, D, E, F, L, M, P, U, V , W, X, Y , and Z have been included in this publication as Chapter 34. The tables are primarily intended to expand the meaning of certain basic groups, but they may be used with any signal from this publication.When adding an item from supplementary tables to the basic group as indicated in its meaning, the table identifying letter must follow the item number.When a signal from the supplementary tables is used with a basic group that contains alphabetical letters in the suf ﬁ x, or when alphabetical letters complete the basic group, the governing group, BV , must precede the supplementary table signal in cases where confusion could exist.When a signal from the supplementary tables is used by itself, the governing group, BV , must precede it; except for supplementary table X, were it may be preceded by 2nd substitute.Numeral ﬂ ags 1 to 9 are not to be used in any supplementary table.Examples: TA2—11—33A—65F ...
Attack enemy main body with antiship torpedoes. M—32W ...Disregard my movements during period of ﬂ ight operations.BJ—25B ...If you desire, operate defensively.BV—33B ...Investigate and board if necessary.c.Special Purpose Signal Tables.The following special purpose signal tables have been included in this publication.(1) Leadthrough Signals—Article 2604.(2) Towing Signal (Flag 6) Table—Article 3007.(3) Helicopter Transfer/Vertical Replenishment Signals—Article 3102.(4) Special Fast Patrol Boat (FPB) Maneuvering Signals—Article 3209.(5) SAG Signal Table—Article 3210.119 Transmission Other Than by Flaghoist a.Call Sign Transmission.Each call sign in the text of a signal from this publication sent by Morse or semaphore will be preceded by the visual prosign, “PT overscored,” meaning, “Call sign follows.” Call signs in the text may be spelled out if conditions make it advisable.
In the text of signals sent by radiotelephone, voice call signs may be used when available, or visual call signs, signal letters, or address groups, spoken phonetically, may be used; voice call signs are to be preceded by the words, “Callsign.” b. Morse Symbols.At the discretion of the OTC, when conditions and operator’s capabilities permit, all of the alphabetical and numerical ﬂ ags and numeral pennants comprising a signal from ATP-1, V ol.II, may be transmitted as their Morse symbols to expedite signaling.NATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 1-11 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDc.Substitutes.Substitutes are used by ﬂ ashing light or radiotelephone only when expediting a ﬂ aghoist preceded by a substitute (ACP-130 series).

1-12 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol. II 120 Readiness to Get Underway 121 Notice to Get UnderwayThe order for number of hours notice for readiness to get underway is issued by the senior of ﬁ cer present.If, because of weather conditions or operational requirements, the senior of ﬁ cer present shortens this notice, ships are to report via the chain of command as soon as possible at what time they expect to be at the new notice.Commanding of ﬁ cers are authorized to shorten their notice for getting underway if they consider it necessary.122 Preparing for Sea When ships are ordered to have power for a speci ﬁ ed number of knots (operational speed) by a certain time, they are to be ready for sea in all respects by that time.123 Getting Underway Because there are many different conditions that may be met in getting underway, no attempt is made here to provide de ﬁ nite instructions that will be applicable in all circumstances.
The following paragraphs should, therefore, be considered of general application only. a.Navigation and Pilotage.Each commanding of ﬁ cer is responsible for the navigation and pilotage of his own ship, and should take action as necessary to avoid endangering his own or other ships.b.Preserving True Bearing and Distance.When ships of a unit in separate berths have weighed anchor together, or slipped from buoys together, they are, until further orders are received, to preserve the same true bearing and distance from the senior of ﬁ cer of their unit as existed before getting underway.c.Casting Ship.When ships are leaving harbour in company, the senior of ﬁ cer may order them to cast to port or starboard or to cast to a particular course.In each case, ships should do so without gathering headway or sternway and should turn at the same rate as the senior of ﬁ cer of their respective units.
In a con ﬁ ned harbour, it may be unsuitable for all ships to cast in the same direction or to gather headway at the same time. In such a case, the senior of ﬁ cer should then indicate the direction in which he intends to cast, at the same time ordering remaining ships to cast as required.d.Sequence in Leaving.(1) An OTC will normally indicate in advance the sequence in which his ships are to leave harbour.After consultation with the local authority, he will promulgate the departure sequence, taking into consideration: (a) Threat.(b) Navigational situation and harbour facilities.(c) Required time/distance intervals.(d) Which berths his ships occupy.(e) Number of ships.(f) Ship types and their characteristics.(g) Weather conditions.NATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.
II 1-13 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIED(2) Should a unit be delayed, the unit commander is to inform the OTC, the unit commanders of succeeding units, and the local authority of the time at which his unit will be ready to proceed. In the absence of further orders from the OTC, the unit commanders are to adjust their times of proceeding accordingly.At night or by day, when not in direct visual touch, each unit commander should when necessary keep the unit commander of the succeeding unit informed of his progress.124 Principal Rules for Maneuvering125 Maneuvering Distances a.Unit of Distance.The nautical mile (2,000 yards) is the unit of distance.In circular formations, 1,000 yards is the unit of distance for circle spacing, unless otherwise ordered.b.Distance and Interval.(1) Standard Distance.The distance between adjacent ships in a line is measured between the foremasts or between the navigation bridges of ships without foremasts.
For the sake of uniformity, the standard distance between two adjacent ships when formed in a line will be 1,000 yards between large ships (ships over 450 feet in length) and 500 yards between small ships (ships 450 feet long or less) and submarines, unless otherwise ordered. The distance between a large ship and a small ship or submarine will be 1,000 yards or the distance ordered for the large ship.See Figure 1-1.(2) Maneuvering Interval.The interval between line guides will be the sum of the standard or ordered distances of the longest line, plus the longest single distance in any one line.See Figure 1-1.(3) Extended Maneuvering Interval.Unless otherwise ordered, extended maneuvering interval, which allows for station-keeping errors, will be the maneuvering interval plus 500 yards.126 Standard and Reduced Tactical Diameter a.Tactical Diameter.Figure 1-2 illustrates the turning distances for a ship on a turning circle using constant rudder angle.
Tactical diameter is the transfer for a turn of 180°. b.Size of Diameter.When ships of dissimilar type or size maneuver in the same formation, tactical diameters will be as follows: Tactical Diameter (yards) Type or Size Standard Reduced Carrier present ....................2,500 1,500 More than one cruiser or large ship present; logistic or large amphibious ship present .......1,200 1,000 Only one cruiser or large ship present ........1,000 800 Only small ships and submarines present ......800 600 Note: Reduced tactical diameter will be used for turns of unspeci ﬁ ed amount and emergency turns.1-14 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II Figure 1-1.Standard Distances and Maneuvering Intervals NATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 1-15 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIED Figure 1-2.Turning Distances c.Changing Size of Diameter .
A type or unit commander may, however, order a different standard tactical diameter or a different reduced tactical diameter for his ships. d.Amount of Rudder Used.For precision in maneuvers, the amount of rudder used by individual ships must be adjusted so that they turn as nearly as possible with the same turning circle as their guide.e.Diverse Forces.When diverse ship types of different nationalities are present and confusion could arise, the OTC is to order the sizes of the standard and reduced tactical diameters to be used.f.Aircraft Carriers.Turns by aircraft carriers may not conform to listed tactical diameter due to ﬂ ight deck heel constraints during periods of aircraft operations.127 Acceleration and Deceleration a.Changing Speed.Ships operating together should normally employ uniform acceleration and deceleration rates when changing speed.This is necessary for smoothness of maneuver to facilitate station keeping.b.Tables.
The OTC or type commander may prescribe acceleration and deceleration tables as a guide. Figure 1-3 is an example for use by a formation containing one or more aircraft carriers.c.Emergency Acceleration.Emergency acceleration is to be at double the normal rate prescribed by the OTC; that is, accomplished in one-half the time.1-16 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II Figure 1-3.Example Acceleration and Deceleration Table 128 Speeds While Maneuvering a.Method of Ordering.Operational and stationing speeds will be ordered by signal or issued in orders to the formation.They will also be signaled to any unit joining.b.Reserve Speed for Station Keeping.When ships are maneuvering, the signaled speed should be appreciably less than the operational speed, so as to leave a reserve power for taking up and keeping station.On other occasions, one knot less than the operational speed leaves a suf ﬁ cient margin for station keeping.c.
Establishing Stationing Speed. The use of a speed slower than operational speed normally enables changes of station to be completed within an acceptable time.This speed, known as stationing speed, should be previously established, either by signal or in operation orders, particularly when substantial economy of fuel will result.Ordering stationing speed does not restrict the OTC from signaling any speed up to operational speed.NATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 1-17 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDd.Speed When Taking or Changing Station.When a unit being maneuvered in formation by its unit commander needs to increase speed to take or change station, the speed ordered for that unit is normally to be one knot less than stationing speed.Ships needing to increase speed when taking or changing station independently should normally proceed at stationing speed.e.Change in Signaled Speed.
When the speed of the Guide is changed by signal during a maneuver involving units taking station on the Guide, ships in the unit being maneuvered are not to change to the Guide’s new speed until so ordered by their unit commander. f.Rough Weather.In rough weather, commanding of ﬁ cers are to report to their unit commander on inability to maintain signaled speed without damage and are authorized to reduce speed as necessary.129 Speed FlagsIn order to facilitate station keeping, the speed at which a ship is proceeding may be indicated by small-sized numeral ﬂ ags displayed from the navigation bridge or by regular-sized ﬂ ags at the dip from an outboard signal halyard.Speed ﬂ ags are normally used only when entering or leaving harbor in formation, when minesweeping, or when ordered by the unit commander.They are not to be used for ordering changes in speed.which are always to be signaled.
130 Stationing To station a unit is to order it to proceed to a position with reference to the Guide, a geographic position, or an indicated unit. Station is expressed by one of the following methods: (1) A true bearing and distance.Example: STATION 170—5 ...Take station bearing 170° from the Guide, distance 5 miles.(2) A relative bearing and distance.Example: STATION STBD 3—D85—5 ...Take station 30° on the starboard side of (call sign), distance 5 miles.(3) A general relative area, such as the van or rear—an approximate distance may be included.Example: STATION C—1.....Take station in the van at approximately 1 mile.(4) A numbered or lettered station on a diagram.Example: STATION 14 ....Take station 14.(5) The circular method (see ATP 1, V ol.I).(6) The sector method (See Article 198).
131 Hoisting Station Numbers By DayWhen ordered, a ship hoists DESIG followed by her station letter(s) and/or numeral(s) to con ﬁ rm to the OTC that she has correctly interpreted his stationing instruction and to indicate to adjacent ships the position to which she is proceeding. By hauling down, she indicates that she is in station.1-18 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 132 Station Keeping a.Maintaining True Bearing.(1) ON ARRIV AL IN STATION, a unit is to maintain the true bearing from its guide or indicated unit, even though its station may have been ordered by means of a relative bearing or area.(But see ATP-1, V ol.I, for rescue destroyers.) (2) WHEN MAIN BODY ALTERS COURSE WITHOUT SIGNAL to all ships present, stationed units are to maintain true bearings and distances from the units on which stationed.
(3) UNIT STATIONED BY BEARING FROM A UNIT OF A CIRCULAR FORMATION, rather than by the circular method, is to maintain true bearing from the unit on which stationed when the formation axis is rotated, unless otherwise ordered. b.Maneuvering Requirements.(1) WHEN THE GUIDE ALTERS COURSE, the alter course signal addressed to all ships present will instruct stationed units whether they are to maintain true bearings or regain relative bearings.(2) UNITS AUTOMATICALLY FORM PART OF THE UNIT ON WHICH STATIONED, for maneuvering purposes, when stationed on the unit at or inside the maneuvering interval or within one mile of a single ship unit.c.Tactical Requirements.(1) WHEN A UNIT CONSISTING OF MORE THAN ONE SHIP TAKES STATION, including one stationed by the circular method, the unit commander is to place his unit in a formation appropriate to the tactical situation, with the unit guide occupying the indicated station.
(2) WHEN THE OTC SIGNALS A SPECIFIC DUTY , such as “aircraft warning picket,” to amplify the stationing signal, the performance of the assigned speci ﬁ c duty takes precedence over accurate station keeping. d.Adjusting Station to Assist Visual Signaling.(1) Commanding of ﬁ cers are authorized to use their discretion in handling their ships to facilitate visual signaling.A ship in line having an urgent signal to pass to the OTC or unit commander may haul out of line suf ﬁ ciently to do so.(2) Unit commanders may similarly adjust station of their units to facilitate visual signaling.133 Joining and Leaving a.Units Closing or Rejoining.(1) Meaning of Order to Close or Rejoin .An order to close or rejoin means that the unit addressed, except a screen unit, is to come closer to receive further orders.It does not in itself order the unit to take up any particular station.A unit ordered to close or rejoin is not to enter the formation without further orders.(2) Resuming Previous Station.
Should the OTC desire a unit to resume its previous station, a signal to this effect is available. NATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 1-19 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDb.Units Temporarily Detached.A unit temporarily detached is not to act on or to answer maneuvering signals made by the OTC unless its own call sign is speci ﬁ cally included in the address of the maneuvering signal.c.Units Joining.The OTC will normally appraise the force of the expected time and general direction of approach of a unit joining.When within range, a unit joining is to establish communications (EMCON permitting) and identify itself to the OTC, who will pass tactical information as required.Information to be exchanged by surface warships joining a formation and the OTC is given in APP-11.During radio silence, the ﬁ rst ship to sight a unit joining is to inform the OTC and pass any required tactical information as directed by the OTC, using a system within the EMCON plan in force.134 Guides a.
Description and De ﬁ nition. (1) In general terms, a ship on which other ships take station when forming up, or keep station when formed, is a guide.It is called unit guide in a unit consisting of more than one ship; line guide in a line of ships when formed in a multiple line formation; formation guide in a formation of ships; and disposition guide in a disposition.(2) When ships are formed in divisions and subdivisions, those ships occupying the corresponding station to the formation guide may be referred to as division and subdivision guides.(3) The ship on which all other guides (i.e., unit, line, subdivision, division, and formation guides) or, in the absence of other guides, all ships form up and keep station on, is called the Guide.b.OTC’s Ship.The ship in which the OTC is embarked is the Guide unless otherwise ordered or unless the Guide changes automatically in accordance with Article 135.
The OTC’s ship may hoist the Guide ﬂ ag temporarily for identi ﬁ cation when the force is forming up or when a unit joins. c.Designated Ship.A ship (not the OTC’s) designated as Guide is to hoist the Guide ﬂ ag and keep it ﬂ ying until the Guide is changed.When a formation or disposition diagram indicates the station designated as the Guide’s, the ship in that station automatically assumes duty as the Guide and, if she is not the OTC’s ship, hoists the Guide ﬂ ag.d.Designation of New Guide.The designation of a new Guide does not in itself order a shift in stations; ships must, therefore, maintain their present positions but keep station on the new Guide.135 Automatic Changing of the GuideThe Guide does not automatically change when a new task or type organization is ordered or with a change in tactical command.In a formation, the Guide changes automatically only on the following occasions: (1) SHIP BEING FORMED ON becomes the Guide.
(2) LINE GUIDE OF THE LINE BEING FORMED ON becomes the Guide.(3) SHIP BECOMING THE PIVOT SHIP for a maneuver becomes the Guide (see Chapter 7).(4) WHEN REVERSING THE ORDER OF SHIPS IN COLUMN FROM THE REAR, the rear ship automatically becomes the Guide. 1-20 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II (5) WHEN FORMING A LOOSE LINE OF COLUMN, COLUMN OPEN ORDER, OR DIAMOND FORMATION, the leading ship becomes the Guide.(6) WHEN A WHEEL SIGNAL IS EXECUTED: (a) WHEN IN SINGLE COLUMN, the leading ship will be the Guide.(b) WHEN IN DIAMOND FORMATION, the leading ship will be the Guide.(c) W HEN IN MULTIPLE COLUMNS, the leading ship of the pivot column will be the Guide.(d) WHEN FORMED IN LINE ABREAST WITH DIVISIONAL LINE GUIDES AHEAD OR ASTERN, the pivot ship of the leading line will be the Guide.
(7) WHEN WHEELING LINES SIMULTANEOUSLY , the leading or pivot ship of the Guide’s line becomes the Guide and the leading or pivot ships of the other lines become line guides. (8) WHEN ALTERING COURSE BY SEARCH TURN, the wing ship on the side away from the direction of the new course will turn to the course indicated and become the Guide.(9) WHEN THE GUIDE HAULS OUT, the new Guide is as follows: (a) WHEN IN COLUMN, the next ship ahead (if no ship is ahead, the next ship astern).(b) WHEN IN LINE ABREAST OR LINE OF BEARING, the next ship to starboard (if no ship to starboard, the next ship to port).136 Unit, Formation, and Line Guides a.Unit Guide.When within a formation and more than one ship is stationed as a separate unit, the ship designated as unit guide is to keep station on the formation guide; all other ships of the unit are to keep station on the unit guide.b.Formation Guide.A ship in a formation on which the units in the formation take or keep station.
When two or more formations form a disposition; the ship designated as formation guide is to keep station on the disposition guide; all other units of the formation are to keep station on the formation guide. c.Line Guides.The ship in a multiple line formation which becomes the Guide also becomes guide of its line.All ships occupying stations corresponding to hers in the other lines automatically become line guides; if, in any of the other lines, no ship occupies the corresponding station (due to there being fewer ships in that line), the OTC will designate the line guide.Line guides are to keep station on the Guide; ships in a line are to keep station on the line guide.When a line guide makes the signal to disregard his movements and hauls out of the line, the next ship in the line, or, when the line guide is not at the end of the line, the next ship ahead in a column or to starboard in a line abreast or a line of bearing, becomes the line guide.
137 Announcement by the GuideAt night or in low visibility, after execution of a signaled course change, the Guide of a formation may announce, “This is . .., I am turning to port (starboard).” NATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 1-21 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIED138 Special Maneuvering Rules 139 Individual Action to Avoid DangerShips, whether acting independently or in formation, must take such individual action as may be required to avoid danger.When necessary, ships may leave their stations to avoid risk of collision or to avoid navigational hazards.140 Special Rules of the RoadThe following rules are applicable to Allied naval ships and overrule the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea in the circumstances described.a.Right of Way.Priority is in the following order.(1) Helicopters when hovering with sonar in the water are to be considered as ships not under command.A helicopter in the dip or hover is not to be approached by ships within 500 yards.
(2) Mine Countermeasures Units, which includes helicopters operating tethered MCM equipment, have the right of way when showing the appropriate signal over ships engaged in replenishment or ships engaged in the launching or recovery of aircraft. MCM helicopters with gear streamed are not to be approached by ships within 1,000 metres.(3) Ships Engaged in Replenishment (other than VERTREP) have the right of way over carriers and other ships engaged in ﬂ ight operations.(4) Ships Engaged in Launching or Recovery of Landing Craft Utilities have the right of way except over ships or formations showing the appropriate signals and are to be regarded as described at the above stated priority con ﬁ gurations (1), (2), and/or (3).(5) Ships Engaged in Launching or Recovery of Aircraft have the right of way except over ships or formations showing the appropriate signals that are engaged in replenishment (other than VERTREP) or mine countermeasures operations; other ships are to keep clear.
(6) Ships Engaged in Launching or Recovery of Arrays have the right of way except over ships or formations showing the appropriate signals and are to be regarded as described at the above stated priority con ﬁ gurations (1), (2), (3), (4), and/or (5). b.Screen Ships.When a formation consists of a main body and screen, ships of the screen are to keep clear of those of the main body.When, from any cause, a ship of the main body ﬁ nds herself so close that collision cannot be avoided by action of the screen ship alone, she also shall take such action as will best avoid collision.Rule 15 of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea is not to apply between screen ships and ships of the main body (but see Chapter 3 for instructions for individual screening units).141 Sea Manners and CustomsWith the exceptions stated in Article 140, the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea are to be observed by ships in formation.
However, in order to facilitate maneuvering, the instructions in this article are to be observed, but in each case where one ship is directed not to hamper the other, the ship required to keep clear of the other is to conduct her movements throughout that her heading and/or proximity to the other are not such as to introduce any doubts whatsoever as to her intentions. 1-22 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II She should also, if possible, indicate her intentions by signal.However, if doubt does arise, the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (or, where applicable, any local port rule) are to apply, except as in Article 140.a.General Conduct of Ships in the Presence of Formed Units.Ships joining, leaving, approaching, or passing through a formation must not hamper ships already in formation.b.Mine Countermeasures Units.
(1) Vessels or Formations engaged in mine clearance operations (as described in Rule 27f of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972 (modi ﬁ ed 1983)) are not to be approached nearer than 1,000 metres. Under no circumstances is a ship to pass through a mine clearance formation.(2) Helicopters engaged in mine countermeasures operations are to be considered as ships not under command when operating tethered countermeasures equipment (see Article 140a(2)).c.Ships Not in Station.Ships that are not in station are not to hamper those in station.However, ships in station should not stubbornly maintain their course and speed if danger of collision exists.d.Passing Between Ships in a Line.No ship is to pass between ships in a line without (in the case of a junior) asking permission, or (in the case of senior) indicating her intention to do so.It then becomes the responsibility of the ship passing through the line to avoid hampering the other ships.e.
Passing Through a Formation. If ships are required to pass between ships in a formation or between lines, it is the responsibility of the ships passing through the formation to avoid hampering the movements of the other ships.No ship is to attempt to pass through a formation of minesweepers with sweeps streamed.f.Senior Of ﬁ cer’s Orders to Keep Clear.If a senior of ﬁ cer wishes a junior of ﬁ cer who has the right of way to keep clear of him, the senior of ﬁ cer is to issue timely orders.g.Restricted Waters.In restricted waters, a small ship must not hamper the movements of a large ship.142 Executing Maneuver at Prearranged Time a.Ordering the Maneuver.Maneuvers, such as altering course and speed or changing the formation, can be ordered to be executed at a speci ﬁ c time or on arrival in a prescribed position; in these cases no further signal to execute the maneuver will be made by the OTC, though unit commanders may have to make signals to their units.b.
When Signaling Is Restricted. When it is desired to restrict signaling during a particular period in the future, such as during darkness or when nearing the enemy’s coast, the OTC can use the following signal: “The maneuver ordered to be carried out at ___ is to be executed at that time without further signaling.Unit commanders are to issue necessary instructions in advance.” 143 Scouting UnitsSpecial maneuvering rules for scouting units will be found in MTP-01 V olume I Chapter 7.144 Ships Towing Acoustic Arrays or Other DevicesShips towing acoustic arrays or other devices do not have complete freedom of maneuver.They will not normally display lights or day shapes indicating conduct of special operations and are responsible for informing any unit closing them of any special restrictions.NATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 1-23 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIED145–147 Spare 148 Man Overboard—Standard Procedures a.
The ship from which a man falls overboard is to use the following procedure: (1) Use the rudder and engines as appropriate to avoid the man.(2) Drop a lifebuoy; in peacetime, also drop a day/night pyrotechnic marker.(3) Mark the plot.(4) In peacetime, the above information is to be passed regardless of the EMCON plan in force.(5) Sound at least six short blasts on the whistle.(6) Maneuver according to rules set forth in Article 140 or 150, as appropriate.(7) Secure active sonar if tactical situation permits.(8) By day, hoist ﬂ ag OSCAR where it can best be seen; by night in peacetime, display two pulsating red lights arranged vertically (see Article 152) or ﬁ re one white rocket (or one white Very light) (9) In peacetime, any ship may use searchlights as necessary. b.Whenever a man has been reported missing overboard, the ship shall immediately inform the OTC.The OTC shall determine the advisability of initiating a search.
If a search is conducted, the OTC shall designate the search plan and participating units. Ships towing acoustic arrays or other devices will normally require the assistance of another unit to recover a man overboard.The commanding ofﬁ cer of a ship steaming independently shall determine the search procedures for a crew member who may have been overboard for an undetermined period.In each case, the commander shall inform appropriate authorities and recommend the duration of the resulting search.149 Peacetime Recovery Maneuvers a.When in Column.(1) The ship from which the man falls overboard shall stop engines temporarily and hold course, unless it is the rear ship of the column, in which case, it shall maneuver as required to recover the man.The rudder may be used to throw the stern away from the man slightly; the ship is then brought back to the course.
(2) Ships ahead of the one losing the man, stand on at the prescribed speed and hold course.(3) Ships astern of the one losing the man, stop engines and maneuver as necessary to keep clear by hauling out of line: odd-numbered ships, counting from the leading ship of the column, turning to starboard and even-numbered ships turning to port. All ships then resume the course and signaled speed.(4) The rear ship should always prepare to recover the man overboard; however, any ship in position safely to recover the man should do so as soon as possible, informing other ships of her intentions.1-24 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II b.When in Line Abreast or Line of Bearing.(1) The ship from which the man falls overboard is to maneuver as required to recover the man, avoiding a turn toward other ships unless they can safely be cleared.(2) Other ships are to maintain the course and speed.c.When in Any Other Formation.
(1) If a man falls overboard from a large ship, the nearest small ship, or the man-overboard recovery ship when designated by the OTC, is to proceed to recover the man. If, however, it is clearly safe for the ship losing the man to maneuver to recover him, it may do so.In either case, other ships are to maneuver as necessary to stand clear of rescue operations and, if possible, maintain formation integrity.(2) If a man falls overboard from a small ship, it is to maneuver as necessary to recover the man.Other ships are to maneuver as necessary to stand clear of rescue operations and, if possible, maintain formation integrity.(3) In a close formation, a ship of the van should not maneuver to recover a man overboard if risk of a collision exists.It should maintain course and speed unless otherwise directed by the OTC, who may designate a man-overboard recovery ship to make the recovery.d.When Engaged in Replenishment at Sea.
During transfer at sea or replenishment exercises, the following precautionary measures shall be taken for the purpose of rescuing anyone who should fall overboard. (1) If a rescue helicopter is available, it should be at a minimum deck alert during daylight hours.However, if bad weather or special hazards demand, the helicopter should be airborne in a suitable position.(2) If a man-overboard recovery ship is designated, it should be stationed 500 to 1,000 yards astern of the delivery ship.(3) The customer ship is the designated man-overboard recovery ship when no other ship nor a suitably equipped helicopter is available.In this case, both the supplying and customer ships shall ensure that each is prepared to execute emergency breakaway quickly and safely throughout the replenishment.(4) Should either the supplying or customer ship lose a man overboard, life preservers with markers shall be dropped by both ships as close to the man as possible.
(5) The OTC shall be informed immediately. 150 Wartime Recovery Maneuvers a.If a man falls overboard from a large ship, the nearest small ship, or the man overboard recovery ship when designated by the OTC, is to proceed to recover the man if the tactical situation permits.Other ships are to maintain the course and speed.If no small ship is present, the OTC will issue the necessary orders but large ships should not stop in areas where enemy submarines may be encountered.b.If a man falls overboard from a small ship, it is to maneuver clear of the formation and recover the man if the tactical situation permits.Other ships are to maintain the course and speed but are to keep clear.NATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.
II 1-25 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIED151 Rescue Helicopter If a man falls overboard and the tactical situation and ﬂ ying conditions permit, a ship equipped with a suitable rescue helicopter, as designated by the OTC, is to launch such a helicopter to assist in the rescue. Surface ships are cautioned to keep clear when a helicopter is actually engaged in rescuing personnel.152 Man Overboard Lights a.If a man falls overboard during darkness, the emergency may be indicated by man overboard lights.These are two red pulsating lights in vertical line, with the following characteristics: (1) Visible two miles.(2) Visible all around.(3) Pulsating rate 50 to 60 pulses per minute.b.During wartime, man overboard lights will be used only upon direction from the OTC.153–157 Spare 158 Breakdown at Sea a.Avoiding Danger to Other Ships.Should a breakdown occur, such as loss of steering control or failure of main engines, the ﬁ rst requirement is to avoid endangering others in company.
As a means to this end, signals and information to other ships should be given as nearly concurrently with the orders to the wheel and engines as is possible. b.Signals From Disabled Ship.The following steps must be taken by a disabled ship: (1) Sound at least six short blasts.(2) By day, hoist ﬂ ag 5; hoist two black balls.By night in peacetime, show two red lights in accordance with Rule 27 of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea.(3) If a turn is being made, indicate the direction by sounding one short blast if the turn is to starboard and two if to port.(4) Inform the OTC of the nature of the breakdown, giving estimated time of its repair and of return to station.c.Maneuvering to Avoid Disabled Ship.(1) When in column: Ships ahead of the disabled vessel stand on.Ships astern of the disabled vessel maneuver as necessary to keep clear and indicate their intentions by the appropriate sound signal.When clear, all ships resume signaled course and speed.
(2) When in any other formation: Ships maneuver to remain clear of the disabled vessel. 159 Night and Fog 160 Navigation Lights on Darkened Ships a.Any Ship Endangered by Others.When ships are darkened, and any ship considers herself endangered by another, she is to switch on navigation lights using dimming feature if installed.Other ships in the immediate vicinity sighting such lights are to switch on their navigation lights using dimming feature if installed.1-26 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II b.When Maneuvering in Formation.When it is necessary to change the formation, formation axis, or course of a screened unit, navigation lights may be switched on if it is not certain that ships will clear each other.
161 Whistle Signals While ManeuveringThe following signals from the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea may be used by ships in a formed state when maneuvering in fog or at night, even though the regulations require that the ships be in sight of one another: One short blast ..............................I am altering my course to starboard.Two short blasts ............................I am altering my course to port.Three short blasts ..........................My engines are going astern.Five or more blasts ........................To be used in accordance with International Regulations.162 Standard Fog Signals a. In Wartime.The standard fog signals, for example, one prolonged blast for a ship under way, are not to be sounded in wartime unless otherwise ordered.b.In Peacetime.
Fog signals by ships in formation are to be sounded in the manner ordered by the OTC, who will take into consideration the confusion that may be caused both to themselves and to other shipping by too strict adherence to the International Regulations when large numbers of ships in company are all sounding fog signals. 163 Entering Fog a.No Change Without Signal.No change in the formation, disposition, course, or speed of the force is to be made without a signal from the OTC.However, when evasive steering is not being carried out, unit commanders may change the arrangement of their units to a compact and more suitable formation.If evasive steering is being carried out, it is to continue until stopped by a signal from the OTC.b.Units Closing the Force.Units closing the force should maneuver so as to make their ﬁ nal approach from well abaft of the beam of the rear ships of the force.
If unable to operate radar, they are not to attempt to join but are to assume the course and speed of the force until otherwise directed. c.Use of Radar.If EMCON plan permits, ships are to man surface radar and the primary tactical circuit.d.Lookouts.Fog lookouts are to be stationed.e.Lights.In peacetime, navigation lights are to be shown.f.Fog Buoys.Ships in column, except the rear ship, should be prepared to stream a buoy at four- ﬁ fths of standard distance and to direct a strong light on the ship astern.164–168 Spare169 Wartime Cruising Precautions NATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 1-27 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIED170 Darkening Ships a.Completely Darken Ship.Unless otherwise ordered, all ships are to be completely darkened from sunset to sunrise, while at sea.A ship is to inform any ship whose lights are visible.Navigation lights are not to be used when ships are darkened except in emergency to avoid collision.Article 160 explains this point more fully.b.
Modi ﬁ ed Darken Ship. To improve habitability, the OTC may order modi ﬁ ed darken ship.Under this condition, doors, hatches, and ports may be opened but no direct white lights or red standing light shall be permitted to show outside the ship.c.Special Conditions.When authorized by the OTC, dimmed side lights and stern light may be permitted during screen maneuvers, when ships join the formation, when individual ships maneuver within the formation, or during coordinated operations.The OTC may authorize ships controlling aircraft at night during darken ship conditions to identify their ship to the aircraft by use of Grimes light or pulsating red truck lights.Ships involved in launching and recovering helicopters may show additional lights at minimum brilliance consistent with safety.171 General PrecautionsShips are to take precautions to avoid disclosure of own forces to the enemy.
These should include measures to avoid excessive external noises and smoke emission, including blowing of boiler tubes. Waste is to be disposed of by sinking or retained on board.Use of electromagnetic, electro-optic, and acoustic emitters is subject to the instructions in Chapter 5.172 Restrictions, Limits, and Requirements for Altering Course Figure 1-4 summarizes the restrictions, limits, and requirements for altering course by search turn, by turn-together, and by wheeling.This table should be read in conjunction with Chapter 6 (TURN) and Chapter 7 (CORPEN).173 Maneuvering Orders and Instructions 174 FormingThe OTC speci ﬁ es the appropriate formation for the existing tactical and operational situation, the Guide, course, speed, axis, and ships’ station assignments.The OTC may direct subordinate commanders to assign stations to their respective ships.
Upon execution of the signal to form an operational formation, ships shall move to their new stations independently, hoisting station numbers by day when ordered (see ATP-1, V ol. II).Units already formed will be maneuvered by order of their unit commanders when the formation ordered is linear in nature and the new formation can be achieved by a unit maneuver.175 Circular Formations a.Formation Center and Axis.The direction of a formation axis is signaled as a true bearing; however, if there is any doubt as to the position of formation center, the OTC is to indicate it by true bearing and distance from the Guide or an indicated ship.b.Circular Stationing.The circular method of stationing is shown in Figure 1-5.The station in the center is called station zero and the circles are numbered consecutively outward from the center.Circle spacing is 1,000 yards, unless otherwise ordered; thus the circle of radius 5,000 yards is known as Circle 5 and that of 7,300 yards as Circle 7.3.
The location of a station is described by the number of the circle on which it lies followed by its direction relative to the formation axis measured clockwise from 000° to 359°. 1-28 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II c.Taking Station.Upon execution of the signal to form a circular formation, ships move to their new stations independently and, when ordered, are to hoist station numbers by day.d.Stationing Units of More Than One Ship.A unit stationed in a circular formation is normally a single ship, but exceptions will occur when it becomes necessary for a unit consisting of more than one ship to occupy a station.Unit(s) so stationed shall not be of such size as to hamper adjacent units(s) and shall take station according to tactical requirements.e.Rotating Formation Axis.The direction of a formation axis is rotated by signaling a new direction; the axis then rotates by the shortest way to the new direction.
A formation axis is not to be rotated more than 60° in one step. Figure 1-6 illustrates rotation of the axis when the Guide is in station zero.(For ease of comparison, ships are in the same initial stations and the formation axis is rotated 30° in both ﬁ gures.)

When the disposition axis is rotated, the OTC of each formation is to maneuver his formation to resume the station relative to the old axis. Unless the rotation is a small one, the maneuver will take a long time to complete.b.Change in Organization or Composition of the Force.When any change in the listed type or task organization is issued by the OTC or when units join or depart, the formation does not automatically change.No ship is to move from its present station until a signal is made orders a new formation or, in the case of a single ship, a signal orders the ship concerned to move to its new station.Screen units may adjust station to cover gaps.When dissolving a formation, the OTC will ensure that the formation is oriented to permit units to proceed on a safe course when detached.Normally, the OTC will detach screen units ﬁ rst; when these units are clear, the main body will be dissolved in an orderly manner.

Terminology. (1) Disposition 4W.This refers to the entire Grid as illustrated in Figure 1-7.(2) Segment.Any square within the Grid.The term segment is used to avoid confusion with AAW Sectors or formation/screen stations.A large segment can be identi ﬁ ed by specifying its borders.(3) Line.The boundaries dividing the segments in either direction (e.g., Line AB or Line 0405).NATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 1-31 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIED(4) Lane.The area between two speci ﬁ ed lines (e.g., Lane C or Lane 04).A number of lanes can be grouped together (e.g., Lane 20-22).Included lanes need not be designated.(5) Point.Intersection of Grid lines.A point is described as the southwest corner of a single square segment with the Grid oriented north (e.g., Point C19 is at the intersection of Line BC and Line 18-19).c.Grid Construction.(1) The 4W Disposition Grid, as shown in Figure 1-7, is 240 nm X 240 nm and is divided into 10 nm X 10 nm square segments.
If a larger or smaller disposition is required the OTC/CWC can use a portion of Disposition 4W, change the size of the squares, or add new lanes in ascending alphanumeric order. 170 1801900 10 20 330340350 230240250260270280290300310320 16020021022050 60 70 80 09 100 110 120 13030 40 140 150010203040506070809101112131415161718192021222324LANE C SEGMENT H24 LANE 20-22 SEGMENT PQ1516 LANE 04 LINE 0405 SEGMENT GP 0406M I N U SN P0 6 LINEABABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZPOINT C19DISPOSITION AXIS Figure 1-7.Disposition 4W 1-32 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II (2) The 10 nm X10 nm segments are described by the letter and number which include that segment (e.g., H24).In labeling the lettered axis, the letters I and O are omitted.Lettering is A to Z (less I and O).
(3) Larger segments are described by combinations of the inclusive alphanumeric boxes which include that segment (e.g., segment PQ1516 de ﬁ nes a 20 nm X 20 nm segment containing subsegments P15, P16, Q15, Q16). (4) The disposition axis is oriented parallel to the lettered lanes.Normally, the disposition axis is parallel to PIM track to allow ef ﬁ cient positioning of screen forces in the van of the disposition.However, if the PIM course changes frequently, or the nature of the threat does not require positioning of screen forces in the van, or the type of friendly forces assigned (e.g., merchant convoy) precludes changing the axis with PIM course changes, then it may be simpler to orient the axis to an appropriate bearing and keep it constant regardless of PIM.(5) The geometric center of the grid is Point N13.Unless otherwise designated this will also be disposition center and PIM origin.d.Execution.
Disposition 4W will normally be ordered by instructions in the OPGEN/ OPTASKs or other appropriate messages. The OTC or designated warfare commander will specify segment assignments for all groups/units.These assignments must be made in close coordination with other warfare commanders/coordinators.Segment assignments may be executed by tactical voice signal using the “STATION S” signal.e.Group Formation.The commander of each group in the disposition is responsible for his group’s formation/screen within his assigned segment whenever more than one ship is assigned.Unless otherwise directed, a group may maneuver anywhere within its assigned segment.f.Disposition Guide.Normally, there will not be a “Disposition Guide.” The disposition moves with PIM.Therefore, all formations in Disposition 4W maneuver with PIM within their assigned segment.
The OTC/CWC will designate a disposition center (normally Point N13) and a disposition axis which establishes the position and orientation of the Grid to PIM. g.Communications.The OTC must be capable of communicating with each group at any time.If EMCON precludes HF communications, the OTC must establish alternate communication links.The following communications considerations pertain: (1) Common HF/SATCOM circuits should be designated for intergroup communications.Each group may be assigned separate UHF frequencies for intragroup communications.(2) Warfare commanders should be able to communicate with all units (regardless of groups) having primary capability in their warfare function.h.Maneuvering Procedures.(1) Segment Changes.Periodically, it will be necessary to change segment assignments.To minimize mutual interference or possible hostile action against friendly forces, intra-grid maneuvers should be ordered by tactical signal.
This signal may be transmitted initially over a voice circuit, and should be followed up by record traf ﬁ c. It is essential that all commanders/ warfare commanders and the SOCA be made aware of the details of the change.(2) Shadowing and Marking.Units will frequently be tasked to conduct surveillance or shadowing in a particular segment of the Grid.Units conducting such missions should avoid NATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 1-33 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDentering segments assigned to other groups or units.After arrival in a speci ﬁ ed segment, the movement of a unit will be largely determined by the target of interest it is following.Hence, these units should notify their warfare commander of their entry into unassigned segments as soon as it can be forecast.(3) Planned Course Changes.The OTC’s OPGEN normally will specify task force PIM.The disposition will move with PIM and the disposition axis will be PIM track unless otherwise speciﬁ ed.
NOT RELEASABLE.(a) Large Axis Changes. A large axis change is any change in which rotation results in different segment locations for a unit or group.In this event, the following procedures may be used: i.Reassign Grid Squares.This is done by overlaying the new Grid orientation over the old and determining what the new segment assignments should be.Such reassignments should be included in the signal executing the axis change.This procedure eliminates any requirements to maneuver.However, units may not be correctly aligned to threat axis.ii.Retain Original Grid Segment Assignments.This procedure will require most units to maneuver to new Grid locations.The time required to perform this maneuver will vary and may be considerable.(b) Small Axis Changes.When the disposition axis is rotated, the commander of each group is to maneuver his formation to remain in its assigned segment.
If the before and after position of the segments is such that all ships remain within their original segment, no additional procedures are required. A larger course change can be accommodated using this method by dividing it into a series of smaller course changes over a period of time.(4) Immediate Course Changes.(a) Normally such changes should be made with a TURN signal.The 4W Disposition axis is not changed and all units and groups maintain the same true bearing and range from disposition center as before.Disposition center moves off PIM in direction of the turn at ordered speed.(b) If there is a common net that is being guarded by all TF units, then a TURN signal can be executed by the IMMEDIATE EXECUTIVE method.At least one ship in each group and/or each group commander should be required to acknowledge the signal.NOT RELEASABLE.If there is not a common circuit or if there is enough time, then the DELAYED EXECUTIVE method can be used.
This can be done on a tactical voice circuit, such as the TF/TG OTH Command net, to all group commanders. After this is done, each group commander would put the signal over a local group UHF circuit, such as the Tactical Maneuvering net.Another option would be to send a HIGH PRECEDENCE tactical signal over the TF Broadcast with a speciﬁ ed execute time and direct each group commander to acknowledge receipt.178 Forming Lines in Quickest Sequence a.Formations.Formations which can be assumed in quickest sequence without regard to the numerical order of sequence numbers are: (1) Column.1-34 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II (2) Line abreast.(3) Loose line abreast.(4) Line of bearing (true or relative).(5) Loose line of bearing (true or relative).b.Procedure.Each ship moves to her station independently and forms on the Guide (line guide for line of bearing) or ship indicated.
If the line is already formed, ships are to remain at their present distance apart. If not formed up, ships are to form at standard distance unless otherwise ordered.c.How Quickest Sequence is Determined.The quickest sequence depends on each ship’s present position relative to the line guide or the ship indicated, and not on the numerical order of sequence numbers.d.Instructions for Forming in Quickest Sequence.(1) Forming Column in the Quickest Sequence on the Most Advanced Ship or Ship Indicated.Unless a particular ship has been indicated, the ship to be formed on is the most advanced ship on the present course.The remaining ships are to form astern of her in the quickest sequence according to their positions relative to her.If the ship to be formed on has been indicated, ships are to form ahead or astern of her in the quickest sequence.(2) Forming Single Line Abreast in the Quickest Sequence on the Guide or Ship Indicated.
Ships are to form on the nearest beam of the Guide or ship indicated, relative to her course or to the course indicated.

In reversing order of ships in column in succession from the rear, the rear ship automatically becomes the Guide and increases speed to 1 knot less than stationing speed, passing the ships ahead of her on the side indicated. Other ships reduce speed to 7 knots or as indicated.At the appropriate time, each ship in succession from the rear is to increase speed and take station in the wake of the ship that was previously next astern to her.All ships will maintain speed after taking station in the new column until the OTC reduces speed by speed signal.If the maneuver is ordered when ships have no way on, the new Guide’s speed will be signaled; each ship will subsequently get underway in succession from the rear in time to complete the maneuver.b.Altering a Line of Bearing.When ships are in a formed state, it may be necessary to alter the true or relative lines of bearing: (1) of ships from their line guide or ship indicated, and (2) of line guides from the Guide or ship indicated.
NATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol. II 1-35 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIED(1) Of Ships from Line Guide.(a) True Line of Bearing.If altering the true line of bearing, ships are to move independently so as to form at their present distance apart, in their present sequence, and on the true bearing indicated from the line guide or ship indicated.(b) Relative Line of Bearing.If altering the relative line of bearing, ships are to move independently so as to form at their present distance apart, in their present sequence, and on the bearing indicated relative from the line guide or ship indicated.(c) Guide not at end of Line.If altering the line of bearing by either true or relative method, with the Guide not at the end of the line, ships are to form on the true or relative bearing indicated from the Guide or ship indicated, or its reciprocal, whichever is nearer .

This line formation is employed mainly when steaming at high speed while engaged with the enemy or in conducting a torpedo attack during daylight. This is an approximate line of bearing within 15° of column.Distance may be increased to reduce yawing.(1) Forming.A loose line of column can only be formed when ships are in column.The leading ship is automatically to become the Guide.(a) Without Signal.Loose line of column may be assumed without orders to reduce en ﬁ lade or yawing, to unmask gun batteries, to facilitate reading signals, to avoid smoke, or to reduce wake interference with sonar search.(b) With Signal.Ships are to take station on the indicated quarters of the Guide on an approximate line of bearing within 15° of column.b.Loose Line Abreast.This line formation is employed mainly by an SAU when engaged in ASW searching and a set pattern is not desired.(1) Forming.
Ships are to form within 15° of the nearest beam of the Guide or ship indicated, relative to her course or the course indicated, in the quickest sequence according to their positions relative to her. (2) Distance.Ships are to form at present distance or as indicated.c.Loose Line of Bearing.This line formation can be assumed on the basis of either a true or relative line of bearing.(1) Forming.Ships are to form on the Guide or ship indicated within 15° of the bearing or its reciprocal, in the quickest sequence according to their positions relative to her.(2) Distance.Ships are to form at present distance or as indicated.d.Column Open Order (see Figure 1-8).In forming column open order, ships are displaced on both sides of the course, even-numbered ships (counting from the leading ship) forming to port and odd-numbered ships to starboard.(1) Forming.The leading ship automatically becomes the Guide.
The second ship forms 4° on the port quarter of the Guide and the third ship 2° on the starboard quarter of the Guide; remaining ships form alternately astern of the second or third ship on the appropriate side. (2) Distance.Ships are to form at the same distance from the Guide as if they were in column.If the column is already formed, ships are to remain at their present ordered distance unless otherwise directed.e.Diamond Formation (see Figure 1-8).This formation may be used when mutual AAW support and additional maneuvering space are required at short notice.NATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 1-37 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIED Figure 1-8.Column Open Order and Diamond Formation 1-38 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II (1) Forming.A diamond formation can only be formed when ships are in column.The leading ship automatically becomes the Guide.
The second ship in the column is to form on the port quarter of the Guide, the third ship on the starboard quarter, and the fourth ship in the wake. If there are more than four ships, additional ships are to form a second diamond on the fourth ship, odd numbers (counting from the leading ship) forming to starboard, even numbers forming to port.(2) Distance.Unless otherwise ordered: (a) Ships are to use their present ordered distance as D in Figure 1-8.(b) When the column is formed of large and small ships, ships use the distance of the largest ship as D throughout the formation.(c) When the formation is terminated, ships use this D distance as their present ordered distance when proceeding to new stations.181 Altering Course by Wheeling a.Ordering.(1) Direction.The direction of the wheel must always be indicated.The side to which the wheel is to be made is indicated with the use of the PORT ﬂ ag or STBD pennant immediately after the CORPEN pennant.(2) Amount.
The amount of the wheel is indicated in one of two ways. (a) By three numerals, giving the true course to which the wheel is to be made.(b) By one or two numerals, giving the number oftens of degrees ships are to wheel re lative to the present course.The ANSWER pennant can be used to indicate a wheel to within 5°.182 Wheeling in Single Column a.Execution.The leading ship is to alter course and become the Guide.Remaining ships are to follow round in her wake.See Figure 1-9.b.Leading Ship of a Single Column Alters Course without Signal.When the leading ship of a column is the Guide and alters course without signaling the alteration to her column, the remaining ships of the column are to follow in the wake of the leading ship, unless the leading ship has signaled breakdown, man overboard, or to disregard her movements.When the leading ship is not the Guide and alters course without signaling, all other ships in formation should disregard this movement and remain in formation.
In such cases, caution should always be exercised as prescribed by Rule 2b of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea. 183 Wheeling in Column Open OrderUpon execution of the signal ordering the wheel, ships are ﬁ rst to form column at once, without further signal, then carry out the wheel in accordance with Article 181.They are automatically to resume column open order after all ships have completed the wheel.NATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 1-39 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIED184 Wheeling in Loose Line of Column Upon execution of the signal ordering the wheel, ships in the line are to turn toward the leading ship of the line and follow in her wake to complete the maneuver.On completion, a loose line of column does not reform automatically unless circumstances make it necessary.(See paragraph 180a.) 185 Wheeling in Single Line Abreast The piv ot ship is to alter to the new course and become the Guide.See Figure 1-10.
Remaining ships are to: (1) Increase speed as necessary up to stationing speed to complete the maneuver expeditiously. (2) Alter course independently to regain by the most direct route their previous relative bearings and distances from the pivot ship.(3) Adjust their course and speed to that of the pivot ship.186 Wheeling in Diamond FormationIf a wheel is executed when in diamond formation, the leading ship is to turn to the new course and become the Guide.Remaining ships are to adjust course and speed to regain previous relative bearings from the “Guide” expeditiously.187 Wheeling in Multiple Line Formation a.Ships in Column with Line Guides Bearing Abeam.See Figure 1-11.This maneuver is accomplished as follows: (1) Leading ship of the pivot column is to turn to the new course and become the Guide.(2) Leading ships of the remaining columns are to alter course independently to resume their previous relative bearings and distances from the Guide by the most direct route.
The speed of the remaining columns is to be increased by signal from each column commander to one knot less than stationing speed. (3) Remaining ships are to follow the leading ship of their column.The subsequent reduction of speed of each column to that of the pivot column is to be ordered by signal by each column commander.b.Ships in Line Abreast with Line Guides Bearing Astern.See Figure 1-12.This maneuver is accomplished as follows: (1) Leading line is to alter course as described in Article 185.(2) Each succeeding line is to alter course in a similar manner, in the same water as that in which the leading line wheeled.At the appropriate moment, each line commander will order his line to wheel.c.Adjusting Speed of Pivot.(1) Ordering.At the same time that the OTC orders the wheel, he may reduce the speed of the pivot ship or pivot column, to expedite the completion of the maneuver.
This reduction is effected by ordering a new signaled speed, which remains in force until otherwise ordered. 1-40 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II (2) In Column with Line Guides Bearing Abeam.If the speed is reduced when in column with line guides bearing abeam, all ships of the pivot column are to proceed at the new signaled speed at the same time as the Guide.(3) In Line Abreast with Line Guides Bearing Astern.In this situation, all lines except the leading line are to proceed at the new signaled speed at the same time as the Guide.Figure 1-9.Wheeling in Single Column NATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 1-41 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIED Figure 1-10.Wheeling in Single Line Abreast Figure 1-11.Wheeling in Multiple Line Formations 1-42 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II Figure 1-12.
Wheeling with Lines Guide Bearing Astern 188 Special Methods for Altering Course For occasions when a simple turn-together (Chapter 6) or wheel (Chapter 7) does not meet the requirements of the OTC, various special methods for altering course are available. A special method is signaled by the CORPEN pennant followed by an alphabetical ﬂ ag and three numerals (see Chapter 7).When carrying out the meaning of these signals, course is to be altered the shortest way.If it is necessary to specify the direction of the alteration, the STBD pennant or PORT ﬂ ag is to follow the three numerals.a.Lines or Units Wheeling Simultaneously.See Figures 1-13 and 1-14.(1) Restrictions.If line guides are at less than maneuvering interval apart, wheels in this manner are to be limited so that lines do not become unduly close during the maneuver.The restrictions on wheeling (Article 172) apply to each line separately.(2) Execution.Each line or unit designated is to wheel simultaneously to the new course.
On completion of the maneuver, ships in each line will be in their former relative positions, and line guides will have maintained their true bearings and intervals from the Guide. b.Each Unit Maintaining True Bearing from the Guide.(1) Use.This method is for use if the OTC does not wish to use a general turn-together when any unit consisting of more than one ship is present.If only single-ship units are present, a general turn-together should be ordered instead.(2) Execution.At the time ordered, single-ship units are to turn individually to the new course.Remaining units are to turn to the new course as directed by their unit commanders, who have discretion as to the method of altering the course of their units and their resulting formation.NATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 1-43 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIED Figure 1-13.Wheeling Lines Simultaneously Figure 1-14.Wheeling Units Simultaneously 1-44 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II c.
Each Unit Maintaining Relative Bearing. (1) Execution When in a Circular Formation.When ships in a circular formation are to alter course with units maintaining relative bearings, the course is altered to the new course and the formation axis rotated (see Chapter 7) the same number of degrees in the same direction.Altering course and rotating the axis may be done successively or simultaneously.If done successively, course may be altered by a turn-together or by the method described in paragraph b above; the axis should then be rotated to conform with the maximum of 60° in one step.If done simultaneously, the method described in paragraph d below should be used.(2) Execution When Not in a Circular Formation.At the time ordered, the Guide is to turn to the new course; remaining units are to regain their relative bearings and distances from the Guide.Single-ship units are to proceed independently, remaining units by order of their unit commanders.d.
Altering Course and Rotating Formation Axis Simultaneously When in a Circular Formation. In good visibility, the course may be altered simultaneously with the rotation of the formation axis (see Chapter 7) the same number of degrees in the same direction or to the same true direction.(1) Restriction.Alteration of course and axis simultaneously is not to exceed 60° in one step.(2) Caution.Simultaneous alteration of course and formation axis should not be carried out at night or in low visibility.(3) E xecution.The Guide is to turn to the new course.Single-ship units are to alter course and speed individually; remaining units are to proceed by order of their unit commanders.All units regain: (a) Their stations relative to the new formation axis on the new course, if the axis is rotated to the same true direction.(b) Their previous relative bearings and distances from the Guide on the new course, if the axis is rotated the same number of degrees in the same direction.e.
Altering Course by the Conforming Method. When it is desired that the unit containing the Guide should pass through waters already traversed by advanced units and when the OTC can forecast the time at which he intends to alter course, the conforming method is available.(1) Restriction.This method is not to be used when in a circular formation.(2) Caution.If evasive steering is being carried out, the OTC should order the formation to stop evasive steering and resume the base course before the most advanced unit is due to alter course.(3) Execution.Units with stations on the Guide’s line of advance, either ahead or astern, are to alter course on passing through the position where the Guide alters course.Units not on the Guide’s line of advance, on arrival abeam of the point where the Guide alters course, are to proceed to their stations relative to the new course.Single-ship units are to proceed independently, remaining units by order of their unit commanders.f.
Altering Course by Search Turn. The search turn (see Figure 1-15) is for use when altering course while searching an area with ships in line abreast or loose line abreast.NATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 1-45 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIED(1) Restriction.Ships in line abreast must be at least 1,000 yards apart; those in loose line abreast must be at least 1,500 yards apart.Ships of ocean minesweeper size and smaller may conduct search turns when the distance between ships is 500 yards.The alteration must not be less than 45° or more than 135°.(2) Execution.The wing ship on the side away from the direction of the new course is to turn to the course indicated and become the Guide.The remaining ships are to continue their course, each one turning in sequence, so that on completion of her turn she will be on the beam of the Guide on the new course.
For large alterations when in loose line abreast, the OTC should consider ordering ships to reform in line abreast before executing the search turn. 189 Evasive Steering Instructions for zigzagging and weaving are contained in ATP-3.172 Figure 1-15.Search Turn 1-46 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 190 Miscellaneous Instructions The instructions in this section cover: (1) Substitutes.(2) Units of reference.(3) Fractions.(4) Times and dates.(5) Position.(6) Bearing, direction, and distance.(7) Courses and speeds.(8) Standard sector system.191 Substitutes a.Use.Substitutes are used only when signaling by ﬂ ags, except as noted in paragraph 119c.They are written as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th.b.Purpose.Substitutes are used to repeat a ﬂ ag or pennant in the same hoist only.c.Application.Substitutes are used in the following manner: (1) FIRST substitute repeats the ﬁ rst ﬂ ag or pennant in a hoist.
(2) SECOND substitute repeats the second ﬂ ag or pennant in a hoist. (3) THIRD substitute repeats the third ﬂ ag or pennant in a hoist.(4) FOURTH substitute repeats the fourth ﬂ ag or pennant in a hoist.When two or more halyards are used to hoist a signal, each hoist is to be considered separately as regards substitutes.When a tackline is used to separate the components of a hoist, it is disregarded in the substitute count.Once a substitute has been used, it is no longer to be thought of as a substitute, but as the ﬂ ag or pennant for which it has been substituted.Examples: T1410 may be hoisted as T 1 4 2nd 0 161416 may be hoisted as 1 6 1st 4 3rd 2nd 192 Units of Reference When a signal makes reference to numbers, distances, ranges, heights, depths, speeds, or weights, the unit of reference is as indicated below, unless otherwise stated in the meaning of the signal.
However, for clarity, the units of reference are stated against some groups using the standard units which otherwise would not need such a statement. For international use, the units of measurement of the nation concerned may be used.NATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 1-47 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDAltitude...................................................................hundreds of feet Distance.................................................................nautical miles (2,000 yards)Range ....................................................................hundreds of yardsHeight ....................................................................feetDepth .....................................................................feetSpeed ....................................................................knotsWeight ...................................................................tons (2,000 pounds)Sector boundaries .................................................

Date-time groups in the text of signals are expressed as six numerals plus the zone indicator: the ﬁ rst pair of numerals denotes the date, the second pair the hours, and the third pair the minutes. When unable to make this display in one hoist, it may be broken between the date and the time group.Example: CO4—20...ﬁ rst hoist 1000Z ....second hoist Comply with my message 201000Z.c.Flag T as Indicator.When desiring to signal a time in conjunction with a signal group, the time indicator, Flag T, will be used as follows: (1) T Preceding Numerals.The time indicator T preceding numerals signi ﬁ es that action is to (or will) commence at that time.(2) T Following Numerals.The time indicator T following numerals signi ﬁ es that action is to (or will) be completed by that time.1-48 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II (3) Numerals Preceding and Following T.
Numeral groups preceding and following the time indicator T indicate time by which action is to be completed and time at which action is to commence, respectively. (4) T Preceding Numerals Alone.If the signal consists only of T plus two or four numerals, it signi ﬁ es a time check.The time of execution is the time indicated.Examples: TA36 ..Show no light.TA36—T1845 ...Show no light.Action is to commence at 1845.TA36—18 ANS T ...Show no light.Action is to be completed by 1830.TA36—19T1845 ...Show no light.Action is to commence at 1845 and is to be completed by 1900.d.Omission of Flag T.When time is referred to in the meaning of a signal group, the time indicator Flag T may be omitted if the omission cannot cause any ambiguity.Examples: ED14 ...Unmoor (at ____ ).ED14—1745 ...Unmoor at 1745.ED14—18 ....Unmoor at 1800.e.Signals Governed by the Same Time Signal.A time signal applies only to the group immediately preceding it.
When it is required to apply to two or more groups preceding it, “BT” is inserted before the ﬁ rst of the groups to which the time signal is to apply. Examples: FORM 3—CORPEN STBD 275—SPEED 15—T13......FORM 3 and CORPEN STBD 275 are to be executed when hauled down.SPEED 15 will be carried out at 1300 GMT.BT—FORM 3—CORPEN STBD 275—SPEED 15—T13 ...In this case, all signals between BT and T13 will be carried out at 1300 GMT.f.Canceling a Signal.NEGAT over a time signal cancels all signals governed by that time signal.g.BT Hoisted Separately.If BT is hoisted separately as the ﬁ rst hoist and left ﬂ ying during several successive hoists, all hoists made in this period will be executed when BT is hauled down.No time signal is needed with this method of execution.h.Time Zone Indicators.All times signaled throughout this book refer to GMT (ZONE 0 (Z)), unless otherwise indicated; suf ﬁ xes, therefore, are not required except to indicate the exception, as below: Example: TA36—T18R...

(2) Reference should be made to a Time Zone Chart in order to learn the exact zone boundaries, since they sometimes deviate slightly to accommodate national boundaries, and so forth. For time midway between zones, the zone to be utilized will be designated by the OTC.195 Position a.Latitude and Longitude.Position in latitude and longitude will be signaled by two four- numeral groups, each group preceded by the letter P.The ﬁ rst group will denote degrees and minutes of the latitude, the second group will denote degrees and minutes of the longitude.(1) Addition of Letters.When confusion may arise, the letters N, S, E, or W may be added to denote North, South, East, or West.(2) Additional Numerals.When signaling longitudes over 100, ﬁ ve numerals may be used if necessary to avoid ambiguity.b.Omission of Flag P.When position is referred to in the meaning of a signal group, the position indicator P may be omitted if the omission cannot cause ambiguity.Examples: NA 22 ...
My position (or ____ ) is as indicated by accompanying position signal. Time may be indicated by time signal.NA 22—3215—7023—T16 ...My position is latitude 32°15’ longitude 70°23’ at 1600.c.Standard Position Indicators.Standard positions in the force are: (1) QQ—The center of the front of the main body or convoy when not in a circular formation.(2) TT—Originator’s present position.1-50 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II (3) XX—The standard position established by the OTC on which a search, enemy reporting, and so forth, is to be based.(4) YY—Addressee’s present position.(5) ZZ—The center of the force.This standard position should not be used in convoy signaling, standard position QQ being used instead.196 Bearing, Direction, and Distance a.Reference Points.Bearings and distances may be signaled from: (1) A point on the earth’s surface specially designated by double letters or code names; e.g., 125MM45.
(2) A point of land or navigational mark; e.g., 112 HATTERAS 12.(3) A standard position in the force; e.g., 310ZZ7.(4) A ship or unit; e.g., 273—Dp4p1—12 (visual); 273 CALL SIGN HOTSHOT 12 (voice). b.Bearings and Directions.(1) True Bearing.True bearing is signaled by three numerals.Such a signal may be used in conjunction with any signal group to indicate the bearing of the subject of that group, provided another meaning for three numerals following is not given in the meaning or instructions for that group.(2) Relative Direction.Relative direction may be signaled by the PORT Flag or STARBOARD Pennant.One or two numerals may be used to indicate the number of tens of degrees from right-ahead (dead ahead) following the PORT Flag or STARBOARD Pennant.Examples: PORT 5....50° on the port bow.STBD 0....Right-ahead.c.Bearing and Distance.
Unless otherwise stated in the meaning of a signal, bearing and distance from a position or unit are indicated by the numeral group for bearing, followed by the position or unit indicated (if required), and then the numeral group for distance in miles. Examples: STATION X 5 ....Take station as communication linking ship.STATION X 5—045—Dp8p4—15—18 ANS T ......Destroyer 3: prepare to take station as communication linking ship on bearing 045° true from ship D84, distance 15 miles, to be in station by 1830.197 Courses and Speeds a.Courses.Courses are signaled by using the appropriate Corpen signal from Chapter 7.When the course is referred to in the meaning of a signal, the special pennant Corpen may be omitted provided there can be no ambiguity.Corpen signals maybe used in conjunction with any signal group to indicate the course of the subject of the group.NATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 1-51 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDExamples: CORPEN U 135 ...Maintain course 135°.
TA97—1—180 . ..Disengage ahead on course 180°.G FORM 3 Dp2p7—G CORPEN 270 ...Guide of this unit is Destroyer 27.Guide’ s course is 270°.b.Speeds.Unless otherwise stated in the meaning of the signal, a numeral group immediately following an informative course signal indicates speed in knots.Example: K CORPEN 045—20 ...Course is 045°, speed 20 knots.198 Standard Sector System The standard sector system may be used for ordering sector screens and in all other cases in which sectors may be ordered.The sector method is illustrated in Figure 1-16.a.Sector Allocation.Sectors are allocated by indicating sector boundaries and, if necessary, sector depth, separated by TACK, followed by the call sign of the unit assigned to that sector.b.Sector Boundaries.Sector boundaries are ordered by a group of four numerals.First two numerals indicate the true bearing of the left boundary in tens of degrees, second two numerals indicate the true bearing of the right boundary in tens of degrees.
Use ANSWER to order an increment of 5°. c.Sector Depth.Sector depth is ordered by a group of four numerals.First two numerals indicate inner and second two numerals indicate outer limit of sector in thousands of yards from the unit, reference point, or standard position indicated.Use ANSWER to order an increment of 500 yards.d.Helicopters not Speci ﬁ ed.Sectors assigned to unspeci ﬁ ed helicopters must be indicated by adding DESIG H after the sector assigned and in place of the call sign.Examples: SCREEN K—ZZ—0307—0510 Dp1p6....Form sector screen.Screen center is the center of the force.Destroyer 16 take sector between 030° and 070° true and between 5,000 and 10,000 yards from screen center.SCREEN K—QQ—20 ANS 33 ANS—02 ANS 07 DESIG H ...Form sector screen.Screen center is the front of the main body.Helicopter take sector between 205° and 335° true and between 2,500 and 7,000 yards from screen center.AA6—2529 ...Threat is from sector between 250° and 290° true.

To station a unit is to order it to proceed to a position with reference to the Guide, a geographic position, or an indicated unit.When ordered, a ship hoists DESIG followed by her station letter(s) and/or numeral(s) by day to con ﬁ rm to the OTC that she has correctly interpreted his stationing instructions and to indicate to adjacent ships the position to which she is proceeding.By hauling down, she indicates that she is in station.a.Maintaining True Bearing.(1) ON ARRIV AL IN STATION, a unit is to maintain the true bearing from its guide or indicated unit, even though its station may have been ordered by means of a relative bearing or area.
(2) WHEN MAIN BODY ALTERS COURSE WITHOUT SIGNAL to all ships present, stationed units are to maintain true bearings and distances from the units on which stationed. (3) UNIT STATIONED BY BEARING FROM A UNIT OF A CIRCULAR FORMATION, rather than by the circular method, is to maintain true bearing from the unit on which stationed when the formation axis is rotated, unless otherwise ordered.b.Maneuvering Requirements.(1) WHEN THE GUIDE ALTERS COURSE, the alter course signal addressed to all ships present will instruct stationed units whether they are to maintain true bearings or regain relative bearings.(2) UNITS AUTOMATICALLY FORM PART OF UNIT ON WHICH STATIONED, for maneuvering purposes, when stationed on the unit at or inside the maneuvering interval or within one mile of a single ship unit.c.
Tactical Requirements (1) WHEN A UNIT CONSISTING OF MORE THAN ONE SHIP TAKES STATION, including one stationed by the circular method, the unit commander is to place his unit in a formation appropriate to the tactical situation, with the unit guide occupying the indicated station. (2) WHEN THE OTC SIGNALS A SPECIFIC DUTY , such as “aircraft warning picket,” to amplify the stationing signal, the performance of the assigned speci ﬁ c duty takes precedence over accurate station keeping.d.Exchanging and Changing Station.When two ships in a formation are ordered to exchange stations, the rules given under STATION J will apply.When a change in the formation is ordered that requires only one ship to move to a new station, she is to proceed to her new station by the shortest route which will not interfere with other ships.When a change in formation is ordered that requires two or more ships to move to a new station, they are to comply with the rules for exchanging station.

If the lines are formed with line guides bearing abeam, the ship in the port line is to pass astern of the ship in the starboard line; if line guides are bearing astern or are in a line of bearing, the ship in the rear line is to leave the other on the port hand. If the ship in the rear line is to port of the ship with which she is exchanging stations, she is to pass astern of the ship in the leading line.4.Ships Not in a Line.With respect to each other, both ships are to act in accordance with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea.5.Ships in Diamond Formation.Ships exchanging stations use rule for both ships in same column, line abreast or line of bearing, whichever is applicable.6.Large and Small Ships.Exchanging station between ships of different size (large/small) should be avoided if possible because of the difference in future and previous distances between these and other units.
If required to exchange station between ships of different sizes, the OTC must ﬁ rst order a distance of 1,000 yards for all units.

CORPEN CORPEN NATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II 7-1 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDCHAPTER 7 Corpen 700 Instructions 701 Ordering a Wheel702 Action Signals703 Information Signals 700 Instructions See Chapter 1.a.Single Line Formations (1) Wheeling in Single Column.The leading ship is to alter to the new course and become the Guide.Remaining ships are to follow round in her wake.When the leading ship of a column is the Guide and alters course without signaling the alteration to her column, the remaining ships of the column are to follow in the wake of the leading ship, unless the leading ship has signaled breakdown, man overboard, or to disregard her movements.
When the leading ship is not the Guide and alters course without signaling, all other ships in formation should disregard this movement and remain in formation. In such cases, caution should always be exercised as prescribed by Rule 2b of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea.(2) In Column Open Order.Upon execution of the signal ordering the wheel, ships are ﬁ rst to form column at once, without further signal, then carry out the wheel in accordance with paragraph (1).They are automatically to resume column open order after all ships have completed the wheel.(3) In Loose Line of Column.Upon execution of the signal ordering the wheel, ships in the line are to turn toward the leading ship of the line and follow her wake to complete the maneuver.On completion, a loose line of column does not reform automatically unless circumstances make it necessary.(4) Wheeling in Single Line Abreast.The pivot ship is to alter to the new course and become the Guide.
Remaining ships are to: increase speed as necessary up to stationing speed to complete the maneuver expeditiously; alter course independently to regain by the most direct route their previous relative bearings and distances from the pivot ship; and adjust their course and speed to that of the pivot ship. (5) Diamond Formation.If a wheel is executed when in diamond formation, the leading ship is to turn to the new course and become the Guide.Remaining ships are to adjust course and speed to regain previous relative bearings from the “Guide” expeditiously.b.Multiple Line Formations (1) Ships in Column with Line Guides Bearing Abeam.The leading ship of the pivot column is to turn to the new course and become the Guide.Leading ships of the remaining columns are to alter course independently to resume their previous relative bearings and distances from the Guide by the most direct route.
The speed of the remaining columns is to be increased by signal from each column commander to one knot less than stationing speed. Remaining ships are to follow the leading ship of their column.The subsequent reduction of speed of each column to that of the pivot column is to be ordered by signal by each column commander.(2) Ships in Line Abreast with Line Guides Bearing Astern.The Guide changes to the pivot ship on execution of the signal.The leading line is to alter course as described in paragraph a(4).Each succeeding line is to alter course in a similar manner, in the same water as that in which 7-2 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II the leading line wheeled.At the appropriate moment each line commander will order his line to wheel.(3) Adjusting Speed of Pivot.At the same time that the OTC orders the wheel, he may reduce the speed of the pivot ship or pivot column, to expedite the completion of the maneuver.
This reduction is effected by ordering a new signaled speed, which remains in force until otherwise ordered. If the speed is reduced when in column with line guides bearing abeam, all ships of the pivot column are to proceed at the new signaled speed at the same time as the Guide.In line abreast with line guides bearing astern, all lines except the leading line are to proceed at the new signaled speed at the same time as the Guide.701 Ordering a Wheel The direction of the wheel must always be indicated.The side to which the wheel is to be made is indicated with the use of the PORT ﬂ ag or STBD pennant immediately after CORPEN.The amount of the wheel is indicated in one of two ways: 1.By three numerals, giving the true course to which the wheel is to be made.2.By one or two numerals, giving the number of tens of degrees ships are to wheel relative to the present course.The ANSWER pennant can be used to indicate a wheel to within 5°.a.Restrictions.
Wheels are not to be carried out when ships are in a circular formation or formed on a line of bearing, or when the line guides are neither astern nor abeam of one another, except that each line may be ordered to wheel simultaneously. A wheel is limited for certain formations: 1.WHEN SHIPS ARE IN SINGLE COLUMN, the wheel is not to exceed 180°.2.WHEN SHIPS ARE IN SINGLE LINE ABREAST OR IN MULTIPLE LINE FORMATION, the wheel is not to exceed 90° and is to be limited so that units do not become unduly close during the maneuver.3.WHEN SHIPS ARE IN DIAMOND FORMATION, the wheel is not to exceed 30°.b.Caution.A ship turning outside the wake should not swing beyond the new course, but should remain steadied parallel to the line on the new course.She should then wait until the ship next astern has completed the wheel, before gradually regaining station.
A ship turning inside the wake may ease her rudder as soon as the mistake becomes apparent, but it must be realized that a reduction in speed will probably be necessary to avoid coming dangerously close to the ship next ahead.

(The OTC should then con ﬁ rm the course on which to steady by signal CORPEN A.) When a simple turn-together or wheel does not meet the requirements of the OTC, a special method is signaled by the CORPEN pennant followed by an alphabetical ﬂ ag and three numerals asset out below. When carrying out the meaning of these signals, course is to be altered the shortest way.If it is necessary to specify the direction of the alteration, the STBD pennant or PORT ﬂ ag is to follow the three numerals.CORPEN A ..STEER COURSE ____ .CORPEN B ..BASE COURSE.Adjust base course to ____ .Not to be used with adjustments over 10°.Change of course is absorbed and relative stations regained without stopping evasive steering.CORPEN C ..STOP THE TURN.Steady on course ____ .CORPEN D ..WHEEL SIMULTANEOUSLY.Each line (or unit indicated) wheel simultaneously to course ____ .See Article 188 (Figures 1-13 and 1-14).Each line or unit designated is to wheel simultaneously to the new course.
On completion of the maneuver, ships in each line will be in their former relative positions, and line guides will have maintained their true bearings and intervals from the Guide. If line guides are at less than maneuvering interval apart, wheels in this manner are to be limited so that lines do not become unduly close during the maneuver.The restrictions on wheeling (paragraph 701a) apply to each line separately.CORPEN E ..STEER SAFETY COURSE ( ____ ).CORPEN F ..ALTER COURSE to ____ (at ____ ).Units are to maintain true bearings and distances from the Guide (or ____ ).At the time ordered, single ship units are to turn individually to the new course.Remaining units are to turn to the new course as directed by their unit commanders, who have discretion as to the method of altering the course of their units and their resulting formation.
When ships in circular formation are to alter course with units maintaining relative bearings, the course is altered to the new course and the formation axis rotated the same number of degrees in the same direction. Altering course and rotating the axis may be done successively or simultaneously.If done successively, course may be altered by a turn-together or by CORPEN F; the axis should then be rotated to conform with the maximum of 60° in one step.If done simultaneously, course may be altered with the rotation of the formation axis the same number of degrees in the same direction by CORPEN G, or to the same true direction by CORPEN H.CORPEN G ..ALTER COURSE to____(at____)and ROTATE the formation axis the SAME NUMBER OF DEGREES and in the same direction as the alteration of course.Note: See instructions under CORPEN H.7-4 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.II CORPEN H ..
ALTER COURSE to ____ (at ____ ) and ROTATE the formation axis to the SAME TRUE DIRECTION. The Guide is to turn to the new course.Single ship units are to alter course and speed individually; remaining units are to proceed by order of their unit commanders.All units regain: 1.Their previous relative bearings and distances from the Guide on the new course, if the axis is rotated the same number of degrees in the same direction (CORPEN G).2.Their stations relative to the new formation axis on the new course, if the axis is rotated to the same true direction (CORPEN H).Alteration of course and axis simultaneously is not to exceed 60° in one step.Simultaneous alteration of course and formation axis should not be carried out at night or in low visibility.CORPEN I ..CORPEN J ..ALTER COURSE to ____ (at ____ ).Units are to maintain relative bearings and distances from the Guide.
At the time ordered, the Guide is to turn to the new course; remaining units are to regain their relative bearings and distances from the Guide. Single ship units are to proceed independently; remaining units by order of their unit commanders.This method may be used when ships are not in a circular formation.CORPEN K ..ALTER COURSE.The Guide is to alter course to ____ (at ____ ) (on arrival in position ____ ).Remaining units are to conform.Units with stations on the Guide’ s line of advance, either ahead or astern, are to alter course on passing through the position where the Guide alters course.Units not on the Guide’ s line of advance, on arrival abeam of the point where the Guide alters course, are to proceed to their stations relative to the new course.Single ship units are to proceed independently, remaining units by order of their unit commanders.This method is not to be used when in a circular formation.
If evasive steering is being carried out, the OTC should order the formation to stop evasive steering and resume the base course before the most advanced unit is due to alter course.

Ships in replenishment units alter course as directed by their control ship(s) so as to preserve relative bearings and distances from their replenishment unit guide. Replenishment unit guide will not change during the course alteration(s).Example: CORPEN N 230 PORT ANSWER ...Alter course to PORT to a course of 230° in 5° steps.Procedure WHEN ORDERED OR REQUIRED TO ALTER COURSE, THE CONTROL SHIP EXECUTES THE ALTERATION USING THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE.1.The control ship orders a CORPEN N to the replenishment unit, as described above.2.On receipt of the signal CORPEN N, ships replenishing alongside and/or astern report BF to the control ship when ready to commence the alteration.(BF is also required from the replenishment unit guide if he is not the control ship.) When the ships replenishing have reported READY , the control ship will alter the course of its replenishment unit by using Method A, B, or C, as in the example following.3.
Ships in waiting/lifeguard station will not report BF but will follow in order to preserve relative bearings and distances from the replenishment unit guide. 4.As applicable, on reaching the new course the control ship reports completion of alteration to the OTC by using the signal group BB-M CORPEN.5.If the alteration does not correspond to an exact sum of the size of the steps ordered, the last step is to correspond to the difference.(For example, the ships are steering course 055, CORPEN N 100 STBD is ordered.) The alteration will be by 4 x 10 degree steps and 1 x 5 degree step.When using method CHARLIE by day, CORPEN STBD 1 will be hauled down and replaced by CORPEN STBD ANS for the ﬁ nal maneuver.7-6 EDITION (G) VERSION (1) NATO UNCLASSIFIEDNATO UNCLASSIFIED ATP-01, Vol.

The SAG single-letter signals come into force and may be used between ships without further orders only when the signal, Form SAG (SU11), has been passed.SAG single-letter signals that order maneuvers are to be used only when the ordered distance apart of ships is 1,000 yards or more.2.The single-letter meaning does not use (nor is it intended to use) the full range of meanings offered by the nearest equivalent normal ﬂ ag signal.3.Single letters will be ﬂ ashed continuously until RRRR is received.When a numeral group follows the single letter, the whole group (e.g., G270) will be ﬂ ashed repetitively until RRRR is received.The SAG commander will attempt to ﬂ ash to all ships in the group; but when in line, intervening ships astern are to ﬂ ash the signal along the line.Signal lamps are to be adjusted to the minimum required brilliance at night.4.
Use of single-letter signals does not preclude use of normal visual signaling procedures and signals as well, if the situation demands it. 5.Numerals are to be transmitted very deliberately as their Morse symbols.They are not to be spelled phonetically.6.Ships should not acknowledge receipt until signals have been received at least twice.7.All maneuvering signals are “for information” and are designed to aid ships in conforming to the movements of the Guide and remaining in their loose stations.They do not relieve individual ships of the responsibility for observing closely and conforming to the movements of the Guide.The SAG commander need not wait for the signal to be receipted before altering course or speed.The extent to which he uses this dispensation must depend upon the disposition at the time, amount of alternation, tactical urgency, and state of training of units concerned.8.The SAG single-letter signals shall not be used by, and/or in cooperation with, fast patrol boats.
